# Nodejs-cli-plugin-system
This project demonstrates a simple plugin system built with Node.js and TypeScript. It features a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that allows users to select and apply various text transformation plugins to input text. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new plugins and extend functionality.
